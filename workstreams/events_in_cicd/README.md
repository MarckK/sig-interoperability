# Events in CI/CD Readme

This is a workstream within the CDF SIG Interoperability.

The forming of this workstream was suggested on a [recent SIG Interoperability meeting]( https://github.com/cdfoundation/sig-interoperability/blob/master/docs/meetings.md#may-28-2020) and its first meeting was held on June 8th.

## Scope
Discuss all about what events should be used for in a CI/CD process

## Mission
Standardize events to be used in a CI/CD process

## What is an event?
We currently stick with the [definition used by CloudEvents](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0/spec.md#terminology):
An *event* is a data record expressing an *occurrence* and its context, where *occurrence* is the capture of a statement of fact during the operation of a software system.

## Members
Current members:
